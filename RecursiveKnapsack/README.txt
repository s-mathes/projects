This program recursively maximizes the value of an inventory given a maximum weight capacity, and 
a selection of items (given in myknapsack.data). The selection of items is given in "weight value item"
format. 

Compile using 'make' command, which will create the executable 'main'. 

To run, execute 'main filename max_capacity'. 'xax_capacity' should be a positive integer that describes
the maximum weight that your inventory can carry, and 'filename' is the file that contains the item
selection. To use knapsack.data as a default item selection, execute 'main max_capacity'.

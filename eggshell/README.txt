Project 2: Mini Shell Program

Run command 'make' to compile.

Run command './esh' to run program.

This code creates an interactive shell, named “EggShell”,
or esh. A shell is a command line environment in which users can execute commands.
esh runs an infinite loop that provides the user with a prompt. At this prompt,
the user should be able to enter a linux command which the shell executes.

Examples:
esh> ls -l

esh> NotARealCommand fred joe a
ERROR: NotARealCommand not found!

esh> cat esh.c

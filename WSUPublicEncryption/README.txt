WSU-Pub-Crypt

To compile, run command 'make'.

Generate a text file with some plaintext named 'ptext.txt' which will be encrypted.

To execute, perform the following commands:
./wsu-pub-crypt -genkey						                              // GENERATE KEYS
./wsu-pub-crypt -e -k pubkey.txt -in ptext.txt -out ctext.txt 	// ENCRYPT
./wsu-pub-crypt -d -k prikey.txt -in ctext.txt -out dtext.txt	  // DECRYPT

ctext.txt is the encrypted version of ptext.txt, and is generated by the program. dtext.txt is the unencrypted
version of ctext.txt, and is generated by the program. These files can be named as desired.

This program generates public keys which are stored in pubkey.txt and prikey.txt, and then encrypts
and decrypts a given text using modular exponentiation and prime factorization security. pubkey.txt is 
used in encryption, and prikey.txt is used in decryption.

These files implement a chat server, with no GUI, in Javascript. It uses a server-client model and can host multiple clients
that can both send and receive messages to each other. These files can be opened and executed in an IDE. The ServerMain should be executed
first, and it will wait and open sockets as clients appear. Execute ClientMain to open as many clients as you want.

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence which involves self-learning algorithms that derives knowledge from data in order to make predictions.

THREE TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING
Supervised Learning - labeled data, direct feedback, predicts outcome
Unsupervised learning - no labels, no feedback, finds hidden structure in data
Reinforcement Learning - decision process, reward system, learns a series of actions

MAKING PREDICTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURES WITH SUPERVISED LEARNING
Goal - learn a model from labeled training data that allows predictions of the future.
Training examples -> data input
Labels -> data output
Subcategories of supervised learning - classification task (discrete class labels), regression (outcome signal is a continuous value)

CLASSIFICATION FOR PREDICTING CLASS LABELS
Classification - goal is to predict the categorical labels of new instances based on past observations.
Multiclass classification - the set of class labels is discrete but not binary.

REGRESSION FOR PREDICTING CONTINUOUS OUTCOMES
Regression analysis is the prediction of continuous outcomes.
Explanatory variables - a number of predictor variables, often called "features"
Outcome variables - a continuous response variable, often called "target variables"
Try to find a relationship between explanatory and outcome variables.

SOLIVING INTERACTIVE PROBLEMS WITH REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
The goal is to develop a system (agent) that improves its performace based on interactions with the environment.
Reward signal - information about the current state of the environment usually includes a reward signal.
Reinforcement learning is a field related to supervised learning, but the feedback is not the correct calue, but a masure of how well the action was measured by a reward function.
The agent tries to maximize the reward through interactions with the environment.

DISCOVERING HIDDEN STRUCTURES WITH UNSUPERVISED LEARNING
In supervised learning, we know the right answer beforehand.
In unsupervised learning, we deal with unlabeled or data of unknown structure, and we are able to explore its structure to extract meaningful data.

FINDING SUBGROUPS WITH CLUSTERING
Clustering - exploratory data analysis technique that allows us to organize a pile of information into meaningful subgroups (clusters)
Clustering is also known as unsupervised classification.

DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION FOR DATA COMPRESSION
High dimensionality is when each observation comes with a high number of measurements. Presents a challenge for limited storage space.
Dimensionality reduction - Removes noise from data and compress data in a smaller dimensional subspace while retaining relevant information.

INTRO TO BASIC TERMINOLOGY AND NOTATIONS (page 11)
Training example - a row in a datatable
Training - model fitting
Feature, x - a column in a data table
Target, y - outcome, response variable, class, label
Loss function - sometimes called a cost function or error function.

PREPROCESSING - GETTING DATA INTO SHAPE
Raw data usually doesn't come in a shape/form that is ideal for optimal performance of a learning algorithm.
